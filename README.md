# Mental Health Analysis

This is a project for a university course.

We had a dataset with the answers of the 2019 PASSI Questionnaire and we were asked to do an analysis of a variable of our interest. <br>
Me and my group decided to focus on the mental health variable. Particularly we tried to discover the correlation between mental health and the smoker status and/or alcohol consumption variables.
In the pdf you can find a brief summary on how we developed the project and a commentary on each step.

Our conclusion were: 

- the homogeneous model shows a better fit than the one that assumes independence between the variable smoke, alcohol and mental issue (even if the relevant relationship is between alcohol and smoke)

- there is a significant association between economic situation, pysical health and mental health, the presence of physical health issue combined with bad economic
situation increases the likelihood of having psychological disturbances. 

- we were expecting an higher variability between regions regarding the mental health problem but from the results given by the random intercept model we really can't
validate our assumption
